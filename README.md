# Customer Microcontroller PCB Board Template

Welcome! This repository provides a **custom microcontroller board template** designed for IoT and embedded systems hobbyists. It’s both a learning tool and a starting point for custom projects. **Anyone can add their own ideas, modifications, or features here**: just fork, edit, and contribute!

## What’s Inside

- **KiCad Project Files**: Full schematics and PCB layout editable in KiCad.
- **Sample BOM**: Example bill of materials in CSV format.
- **3D Board View**: Visual PNG previews of the assembled board.
- **Schematics Image**: Quick reference schematic as PNG.
- **Open License**: All files licensed with Unlicense for free reuse.

## Who Is This For?

- Hobbyists exploring PCB design or IoT prototyping
- Students and educators needing a microcontroller board template for embedded projects
- Makers customizing boards for their needs (add, modify, remix as you like!)

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** the repository.
2. **Open the KiCad project** files (.kicad_pro, .kicad_sch, .kicad_pcb, etc.).
3. **Edit**: Add your own components, change the schematic, or modify the PCB layout.
4. **View**: Use the `Schematics image.png` and `3D View.png` for reference.
5. **Contribute**: Share your improvements or new features by making a pull request.
